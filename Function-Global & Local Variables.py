##Global vs. Local variables
##Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope,
##and those defined outside have a global scope.
##This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function
##in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed
##throughout the program body by all functions. When you call a function,
##the variables declared inside it are brought into scope.
##Following is a simple example âˆ’

total = 50 # This is global variable.
x = 10
def sum(arg1,arg2):
   total1 = arg1 + arg2 + x       # Here total is local variable.
   print( "Inside the function local total : ", total)
   # total += total
   # print(total)
   return total1

def sub(arg1,arg2):
   total2 = arg1 - arg2        # Here total is local variable.
   total2 = total2 - x
   print( "Inside the function local total : ", total)
   return total2

# sum(10,20);
print('with return value :', sum(5,5)+total)
print('After subtraction:',total-sub(10,5))
print ("Outside the function global total : ", total)
