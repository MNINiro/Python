# Find the maximum sequence of continuous 1’s formed by replacing
# at-most `k` zeroes by ones

# Given a binary array, find the maximum sequence of continuous 1’s
# that can be formed by replacing at most k zeroes by ones.
# For example, consider the following binary array A:
# Input: A[] = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0}
#
# For k = 0,
#     The length of the longest sequence is 4(from index 6 to 9)
#
# For k = 1,
#     The length of the longest sequence is 7(from index 3 to 9)
#
# For k = 2,
#     The length of the longest sequence is 10(from index 0 to 9)
#
# For k = 3, The length of the longest sequence is 11(from index 0 to 10)
