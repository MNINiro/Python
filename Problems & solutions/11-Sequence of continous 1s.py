# Find the index of 0 to be replaced to get the maximum length sequence of continuous ones
# Given a binary array, find the index of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get the maximum length sequence of continuous ones.
# For example,
# consider the array { 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 }.
# We need to replace index 7 to get the continuous sequence of length 6 containing all 1â€™s.

# Find the index of 0 to replace with 1 to get the maximum sequence
# of continuous 1's
def findIndexofZero(A):
    max_count = 0  # stores maximum number of 1's (including 0)
    max_index = -1  # stores index of 0 to be replaced

    prev_zero_index = -1  # stores index of previous zero
    count = 0  # stores current count of zeros

    # consider each index `i` in the list
    for i in range(len(A)):

        # if the current element is 1
        if A[i] == 1:
            count = count + 1

        else:
            # if the current element is 0
            # reset count to 1 + number of ones to the left of current 0
            count = i - prev_zero_index

            # update `prev_zero_index` to the current index
            prev_zero_index = i

        # update maximum count and index of 0 to be replaced if required
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            max_index = prev_zero_index
