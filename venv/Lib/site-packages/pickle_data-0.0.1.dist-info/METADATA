# Pickle Data
This is an extremely short and simple project with just two functions, one to pickle data to a file, and one to load pickled data from a file.

This project serves more as an introduction for me to learn how to use PyPi.

## Installation
Use the following command in a command line to install this project:

```python
pip install pickle_data
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from pickle_data import load_data
from pickle_data import save_data

# Save something to a file:
save_data('./MyFile.pickle', 'Example Text')

# Load something from a pickled file:
load_data('./MyFile.pickle')
```


# Development Dependencies
To install pickle_data in its development environment to build on it and run tests yourself, run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install -e . [dev]
```
